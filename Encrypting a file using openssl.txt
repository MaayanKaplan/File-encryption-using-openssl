Encrypt and decrypt a file using openssl

1. Creating a private key:
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048

2. I can see the public key using:
cat private_key.pem

3. Creating a public key from the private key:
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.crt

4. To see the public key:
cat public_key.crt

5. I"ll create a new file:
echo "This is a text file that soon will be encrypted." > newfile.txt

6. I'll encrypt the file using the public key:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public_key.crt -in newfile.txt -out newfile.txt

7. We can see that the file newfile.txt is encrypted:
cat newfile.txt

8. To decrypt the file we have to use the private key:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in newfile.txt -out newfile.txt

9. The file now is decrypted:
cat newfile.txt
